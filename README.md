<h2>Instructions</h2>

During the game, the player can constantly see a red dot that can be used to move around and interact with the room's objects. With this in mind, the red dot provides the following functionalities:
<ul>
  <li>Moving - player should look down</li>
  <li>Selecting an object - center the red dot on the desicred object</li>
</ul>

In order for the player to move on to the next level, he must find the appropriate code/key that will open the door. Each room has objects that give out clues as to how the player can get closer to opening the door. When the player gets to the third and final room, he must find the location of the bomb and cut the wires in the right order. The order of cutting is connected to the colors of the wires, which represent the rooms that the players have been in, so they should also pay attention to each of the rooms more carefully.
